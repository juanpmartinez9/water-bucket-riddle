# Water Bucket Riddle

Build an application that solves the Water Bucket Riddle for dynamic inputs (Bucket_X, Bucket_Y, Amount_Z)


## Overview

Build an application that solves the Water Jug Riddle for dynamic inputs (X, Y, Z). The simulation
should have a UI to display state changes for each state for each jug (Empty, Full or Partially Full).
You have an X-gallon and a Y-gallon jug that you can fill from a lake. (Assume lake has unlimited
amount of water.) By using only an X-gallon and Y-gallon jug (no third jug), measure Z gallons of
water.

## Goals

1. Measure Z gallons of water in the most efficient way.
2. Build a UI where a user can enter any input for X, Y, Z and see the solution.
3. If no solution, display “No Solution”.

## Limitations

● No partial measurement. Each jug can be empty or full.
● Actions allowed: Fill, Empty, Transfer.
● Use one of the following programming languages: Scala, Java, Nodejs, Go

## Deliverables

The application source code should be on Github and a link should be provided. If this is not an
option, a public link to the application source code or a zip archive is also acceptable.

## Evaluation Criterias

● Functionality
● Efficiency (Time, Space)
● Code Quality / Design / Patterns
● Testability
● UI/UX design

## How to run the application

```bash
$> ./run.sh
```

Note: you will need [docker](https://www.docker.com/) to run waterBucketRiddle app.
